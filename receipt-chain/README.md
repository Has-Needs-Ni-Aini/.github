# receipt-chain
Traversible immutable user generated contract ledger



The project I want to make evolved from crisis response.

At its essence, I devised a system that celebrates humanity and rewards prosocial interactions.

It matches needs to resources, but acknowledges one’s existence as a value, and encourages non-commodity resource exchange.

I am being asked to rough out a budget. The components are novel and I think obvious when you read below.

At the heart of it is what I’m calling a “Receipt-chain”. I have inquired in Polkadot and DeFi circles, and other places.. but nothing similar has been created and I want to. It is the core of an entire ecosystem of benefits.

It is a self-generated and managed transactional chain. Uses range from token generations for messaging, microtransactions for certain PID, and the usual types of value-exchange contracts.

The secret sauce is metadata accompanying every transaction. Security groupings of Public, Civic, Private - cover the metadata by parties’ agreement. Every single transaction involving PID or any information about your being must have a value exchange of some sort. Having an opinion and breathing is enough to create value. These exchanges are accompanied by a token that enshrines the contract and might have a self destruct component within (?). The value in a Civic channel is usually the service being provided. Otherwise a commercial entity would reward with discounts or merch.

Completely open exchange encourages barter - hugely important post-disaster - that actually creates a local ontology and its relevancy engine on the fly, in locally relevant form. Words, pictures, text, we don’t really care.

The PUBLIC details of your receipt-chain provide authenticate-able details comprising a ‘relevancy’ score for anything the system is being used for.

A high relevancy for undisputed (i.e. positive) transactions equals a favorable “reputation” score.

Relevancy is the basis of discovery within the entire system and how needs/resource matching takes place. Geographic proximity is heavily weighted but invisible to users. Individuals can join any community by consensus, and community actions in Civic channels are more likely to receive meaningful response, so prosocial patterns are rewarded and effective leaders are emergent from the system. We penalize anti-social behavior through peer exposure when they become ‘highly relevant for negative experiences’. Absence of data also creates social alarms, so it isn’t all about explicit requests for things.

To Authenticate a receipt-chain without using a clearinghouse (the obviously faster ‘trusted third party’) - one would query a random transaction, then query the other party and pick a random transaction from *their* receipt-chain. Within a few hops, a highly reliable authenticity score is arrived at. Plus, since this is designed for physical-social interactions, humans are beholden to each other in ways “blockchain systems” cannot be - changing the dynamics of authenticity and security.

The CIVIC Designator comprises a special class of communications and transactions. One’s Civic data includes items that need to be protected from public exposure, but are essential to the delivery of services by governance or aid. Civic interactions have certain metadata exposed to the public in aggregate, to create a running performance metric of Public Servant responsiveness to public Needs, or efficacy reports to charity Donors.
Democratization occurs when one has a measurable impact on governance, and this mechanism sets the power relationship right with timers for aging ‘Needs’ and recognition of those who became their own ‘Resource’ by making them more ‘relevant’ than the elected/appointed leader! Corruption is removed because everyone’s interests are equal in a system where private deals are replaced with a public “To-Do List”.
 Messages sent through a Civic channel notify the original sender of *every* movement or status change to that message, and when the Need is satisfied, the node being communicated with becomes ‘highly relevant’ for that Need.
In this way, a survival network (for example) can be stored and even shared and combined with others. For another example, this mechanism would allow forced migrants and communities to honorably interact before physically meeting. Skills, labor, resources and encouragement could all be communicated and exchanged from a QR code on a sign.

The PRIVATE designator is more like a self managed HIPAA warehouse. A personal data broker would manage microtransactions for ‘spammy’ requests for data, but they are never transmitted “at” the individual. Marketing, instead, is about discovery. The onus on commerce is to provide highly discoverable product. Like the Bazaar model. One’s personal preferences guide search bots, and influencers provide ‘marketing’ through the form of testimonials but their reputation is on the line, so honesty is rewarded.
Upon discovery, a business might offer discounts or free product for individuals with a certain number of followers etc.
PID for medical or other non-civic interactions is provided on a case by case basis, and only the portion included in the token needs to be protected by the end user (in this case, the doctor). In the system I envision, it would be even more useful to allow the doctor’s office temporary access to my ‘health record API’.
Regardless, any PID without accompanying Token discovered in the wild opens the holder to criminal liability.

This is what I want to build. My advisors are mostly in Disaster Medicine and Big Aid response, and I have very recently been approached by two investor groups looking for similar features but didn’t take into account my questions yet. A design built off of two categories (things you have)(things you need) and having individual dignity as the foundation, sets the stage for community support that mitigates post-trauma, reduces cost and corruption in governance, and stimulates equitable commerce.

I envision putting this platform into villages with a shoebox sized community cell tower for free civic interactions and representation.

The future in an empowered citizen scenario, is that governance and aid become customers of highly reliable data.

The result of self-directed and local-to-national systems is improved resiliency and reduced effects of community trauma.

The interactions of needs and resources is planned to populate a virtual globe, for all manner of language agnostic, intuitive analyses and personal planning.






***README for people who think in terms of Blockchain Currencies***

Actually, to me, the real value of my system is the metadata around the transaction allowing one to navigate the world as it is relevant to them.

I envisioned the ‘receipt chain’ to be records of value exchange only. The value in currency or intangibles is within the contract and I don’t deal with that. What I do deal with is the data itself being always and only accompanied by the token for that contract. If it is discovered outside the parameters established, criminal liability arises. Worse for holding PID without a token.

The ‘system’ relies on whatever metadata parties agree to, becoming the ontology for a relevance engine. Could be photographs or spoken utterances as easily as typed entries. Then when I have a Need and publish it, responses are weighted by geographic distance and relevance. If I have a resource or skill and publish it, the same story. I will build up a long receipt chain for the things I do and need. Upon first encounter, I could pick a random transaction in your chain, follow that party’s chain & etc. until a reasonable measure of authenticity exists (remember we are humans who live nearby, the social pressure is part of the system, promoting prosocial interactions). Bad actors are slashed so heavily recovery will support restitution over restarting because new chains will be very highly suspect.

Of course, a trusted third party would provide more instant Authenticity verification as their business would be to track every single public transaction to offer near realtime thumbs up or down. They would likely offer other services based upon your needs and preferences for a fee, but the virtual machine working on your personal data never transmits anything outside of the contract with the service provider, yet uses their compute resources in exchange for some of them.

This came out of disaster response, but evolves beautifully to manage regional and international levels of reality because it’s just a scaffolding for civic interactions. My dream is to run it line-of-sight from solar powered shoe boxes that drop in where needed providing connectivity for free. Costs are realized x100 by Agencies not having to go search for data.


***Authentication Bias***

The authentication bias is designed to encourage local action and peer problem solving. Deciding to enter a transaction (contract) is made more predictable by assessing the validity of the individual you are interacting with. Their history of transactions includes a public level of metadata that can be traversed to determine relevancy for one's needs and reliability score for positive interactions. A Personal Broker AI might churn on an Individuals history to trace their reputability based upon actual behavior. In the receipt chain, Actions are recorded and described, and as part of a Contract, as such, are authenticated by the parties and their repuation history. Its an old ideal, assured by automated accountability metrics.

To traverse a receipt can be costly in time and compute resources, let alone network outages and spoofing interference. The economical path is to deal with those in close proximity. Validation happpens faster, and the social consequences of bad actions are immediate. Transactions with unknown entities or untrustable situations might either wait longer to achive direct validation, or to achieve it much faster - would use a trusted third party clearinghouse to authenticate the other party's receipt-chain.

Because this is a contract container and logistics system, the values being exchanged can be anything. A government 'allotment' in a community crypto, a crypto coin that has a working echange rate with a fiat currency, a direct cash paymentfor services or even unlimited categories of barter are all accommodated.

THIS SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED TO FUNCTION WITHOUT GOVERNANCE OR AID ORGANIZATIONS in a post-disaster/conflict setting. What it does, is put humans in their own driver seat, rewards them for prosocial behavior, and facilitates interactions between providers - in a secure playground.
