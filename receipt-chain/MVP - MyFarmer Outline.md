This is a great idea for an MVP that addresses a significant pain point for small farmers while keeping the design simple and adhering to the ethos of Has-Needs. Here's a detailed outline of how the app can be structured and the technology stack that can be used to build it:

### MVP Features and Workflow

#### User Roles:
1. **Farmers:**
   - Take a photo of the ripe crop.
   - Set the price per unit.
   - Enter the number of units available.

2. **Subscribers (Customers):**
   - Receive notifications about new crops.
   - View the photo and details of the crop.
   - Claim the number of units they want.

#### Workflow:
1. **Farmer Interaction:**
   - Open the app and log in.
   - Take a photo of the ripe crop.
   - Enter crop details: price per unit, number of units available.
   - Submit the crop details to notify subscribers.

2. **Customer Interaction:**
   - Receive a notification about the new crop.
   - Open the app to view the crop details.
   - Claim the number of units they want.
   - The app updates the available units based on claims.

3. **Market Day:**
   - Farmers bring the exact number of units claimed to the market.
   - Customers pick up their produce and pay face-to-face.

### Technology Stack

#### Frontend:
- **React Native:** For building cross-platform mobile applications (iOS and Android) with a single codebase.
- **Expo:** To streamline development and deployment of React Native apps.
- **Figma:** For designing the user interface and creating prototypes.

#### Backend:
- **Node.js with Express:** For building a scalable backend server.
- **GraphQL:** For efficient querying and data handling.
- **Firebase:** For real-time notifications and backend services (e.g., user authentication, database).

#### Database:
- **Firebase Firestore:** For storing user data, crop details, and claims in real-time.

#### Storage:
- **Firebase Storage:** For storing photos of crops uploaded by farmers.

#### Notifications:
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM):** For sending notifications to subscribers.

### Implementation Plan

#### 1. Design Phase:
- Create wireframes and mockups using Figma.
- Design the user interface focusing on simplicity and ease of use.

#### 2. Development Phase:
- Set up the development environment with React Native and Expo.
- Develop the backend using Node.js, Express, and GraphQL.
- Implement Firebase for user authentication, real-time database, storage, and notifications.

#### 3. Testing Phase:
- Conduct user testing with a small group of farmers and customers.
- Gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.

#### 4. Deployment Phase:
- Deploy the backend on a cloud platform (e.g., Google Cloud, AWS).
- Publish the mobile app on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

### Example User Interfaces

#### Farmer Interface:
1. **Dashboard:**
   - Button to add new crop.
   - List of previously added crops and their statuses.
2. **Add Crop:**
   - Camera interface to take a photo of the crop.
   - Input fields for crop details (price per unit, number of units).
   - Submit button to notify subscribers.

#### Customer Interface:
1. **Notifications:**
   - List of notifications about new crops.
2. **Crop Details:**
   - Photo of the crop.
   - Price per unit and number of units available.
   - Input field to claim the number of units.
   - Claim button to submit the request.

### Benefits

#### For Farmers:
- **Reduced Waste:** Know exactly how much produce to bring to market.
- **Increased Efficiency:** Spend less time guessing and more time preparing.
- **Customer Relationships:** Maintain face-to-face interactions, which are crucial for building customer loyalty.

#### For Customers:
- **Convenience:** Know what produce is available before going to the market.
- **Choice:** Ability to claim their desired amount of produce.
- **Reliability:** Ensured availability of the desired produce from their preferred farmers.

By focusing on this MVP, you can address immediate pain points for farmers and customers while laying the groundwork for the broader Has-Needs platform. This approach allows you to validate the concept, gather user feedback, and iterate based on real-world usage.
