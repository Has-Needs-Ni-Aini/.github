Given the need for decentralization, security, and privacy, while avoiding the exposure of IP addresses and ensuring that users remain autonomous, we should consider alternative technologies that meet these requirements.

### Updated Requirements for Has-Needs:
1. **Decentralization:** Ensure all functions are distributed without a central point of failure.
2. **User Autonomy:** Users manage their own data and interactions independently.
3. **Local-First Resource Matching:** Prioritize local interactions and resource matching.
4. **Interoperability:** Enable communication and integration with other decentralized systems.
5. **Security and Privacy:** Protect user data and ensure secure transactions without exposing IP addresses.

  - Complexity in developing parachains.

#### 3. **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)**
- **Pros:**
  - Decentralized storage solution, ensuring data is distributed and accessible.
  - Works well with other decentralized technologies.
- **Cons:**
  - Not a complete blockchain solution but excellent for distributed storage.

#### 4. **DXOS (Decentralized Operating System)**
- **Pros:**
  - Provides a decentralized infrastructure for applications.
  - Supports user sovereignty and decentralized data management.
  - Works well with distributed systems like IPFS.
- **Cons:**
  - Requires understanding and implementation of decentralized OS principles.
