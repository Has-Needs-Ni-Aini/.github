1. Background and Purpose

  Traditional disaster response systems often treat individuals as less human during their most vulnerable moments. Survivors are excluded from decision-making processes despite the acknowledged need for timely and representative data. Aid workers are discouraged from even mentioning scheduled shipments to avoid raising false hopes, and survivors who have received training or are affiliated with prestigious institutions face skepticism about their reports.

  Has-Needs changes this by giving participating citizens complete control over their data. Through real-time requests and offers, individuals can directly negotiate and engage in value exchanges. Blockchain technology ensures trust and verification within the network.

  In practical terms, individuals signed up for the service or with access to a QR code and a feature phone can input their needs, which are then matched with nearby resources. They can also join consensus-based communities, pooling requests and resources while benefiting from geographic anonymity. Potential matches suggested by the system are refined through human intervention, improving accuracy as recovery progresses.

  Aid agencies, seen as communities with their own needs and resources, greatly benefit from accurate and timely citizen data. By sharing this data, individuals contribute to aid delivery, increasing the chances of an effective response. Collaborative need requests provide critical real-time data previously collected by paid employees. This inclusive approach empowers every person in an affected area to actively participate in their own recovery.

  As more people recognize the extractive nature of government involvement and commercial marketing, they feel disconnected from personal information ownership. Has-Needs fills this gap by providing a secure personal chain that protects and verifies individuals' identities.
