In the Has-Needs system, the steady stream of citizen Needs can serve as a continuous, real-time form of voting on community priorities and initiatives. This approach leverages transparency and active participation to shape governance and resource allocation, making traditional voting less necessary. Hereâ€™s how this can be structured:

Key Components and Interactions
Continuous Citizen Input:

Needs as Votes: 
Every Need posted by a citizen is, in effect, one person's vote 'for' that thing they want to have, do, or be. If a system could compile and display these citizen Needs, their wishes would always be available.

Responsive governance will seek the Needs of the consituents and work towards satisfying all of them according to the available resources.

In a democratic system it is hypothetically possible to vote yourself guitar lessons to be paid by the State, but most political systems decide what they will respond to - regardless of the available resources.

As it benefits the State organization to promote a status quo, the citizens will meet resistance up to and equal to their demands for access to those State resources. Where there are no demands, the scene appears peaceful. But if a movement appears to be evolving, then force will be used, for real and/or invented reasons.

However, a system that actually adheres to the results of voter's referenda, where citizens realize demonstrable influence over governance, their input is gratefully encouraged and acted upon.

We also find that informing competing communities of a limited resource generates TWO new entities putting their ingenuity to the problem rather than the typical, one (governance) decision maker. Given infiormation about a limited resource, two neighbors will each internally negotiate whether they will reaffirm a need for it, or reduce their need in this moment. Neighbors on good terms will intentionally begin a discussion to lovingly negotiate an outcome. We also see people who are not aware of each other, independently being told about a scare resource and immediately begin to plot means of accelerated access.

The traditional mistake when approaching this issue is to think "How can we drive voters to participate and thereby increase responsiveness by having more of 'our' people in governance?"

"Voters" will not be driven, or even led. It is 'pushing a rope' or trying to physically push a line of people from behind. it cannot work. Inevitably some bodies will squirt to either side and farther up, others will turn around to see what's going on and stall progress. These are inevitable human traits. That same dogged determinism driving the person to 'not move one step further until they know what's going on back there' will see them through hell and high water to make sure their voice is heard - if they have had that expectation either through education or experience. People who feel through knowing that they are 'free' will fight others to the death in freedom's cause.

The common denominator is an experience of being a voice that is heard. This is captured in Has-Needs because the system is inherently free from hierarchy. Citizens provide anything they Need and their requests are not controlled by governance. Any Need can only be satisfied if the individual accepts a match, so it is possible to know the general state of the governance relationship without compromising privacy. A "responsive" governance will be creating matches consistently based upon the list of Needs they have been provided and the rate of responsiveness would be extremely informative when the next elections take place.
