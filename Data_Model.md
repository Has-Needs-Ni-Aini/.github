The data model is designed to capture and represent the key elements of the system, enabling efficient resource allocation, transparent interactions, and meaningful collaborations. Here is an overview of the data model components:

**User Profiles:** Each user has a unique profile that includes personal information, self-sovereign identity attributes, and preferences. User profiles serve as the foundation for establishing credibility, relevance, and trust within the system. Profiles can include demographic details, skills, interests, past interactions, and reputation scores.

**Needs and Has:** Users can express their needs and offerings through the system. "Needs" represent specific requirements or requests for resources, services, or assistance. "Has" denote the resources or services that users can provide or make available to others. These elements drive the matching process, connecting users with complementary needs and has.

**Personal Chains:** Each user maintains a personal chain, which acts as a transparent and verifiable ledger of their interactions, exchanges, and reputation within the system. Personal chains record transactions, messages, collaborations, and endorsements, ensuring a comprehensive history that establishes credibility and relevance.

**Location-Based Relevance:** The data model incorporates location information to facilitate localized interactions and resource allocation. Users' geographical coordinates or proximity to specific areas are considered in the matching process, enabling nearby individuals and communities to connect and engage effectively.

**Community Chains:** Users have the option to join communities based on proximity or shared interests. Community chains capture the collective needs, has, and interactions within a specific community. These chains enable community-driven collaborations, resource pooling, and collective decision-making.

**Secure Messaging:** The data model includes a secure messaging system that allows users to communicate, negotiate, and coordinate exchanges within the system. Messaging functionality ensures privacy, encryption, and user-defined data sharing policies, fostering secure and trusted interactions.

**Metadata and Validation:** Metadata associated with each interaction, such as timestamps, endorsements, and transaction details, contributes to the validation and verification process. By relying on objective metadata from blockchain entries, the system ensures the authenticity and relevance of user interactions.

The Has-Needs data model is designed to empower individuals and communities, providing a robust foundation for efficient resource allocation, collaboration, and transparent interactions. It promotes self-sovereign identity, privacy, and security while enabling meaningful connections and exchanges between users.
