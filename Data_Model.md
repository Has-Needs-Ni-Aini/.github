The data model is designed to capture and represent the key elements of the system, enabling efficient resource allocation, transparent interactions, and meaningful collaborations. Here is an overview of the data model components:

**User Chains:** Each user has a unique 'core wallet' address of their own chain that interacts through an alias management system, providing authentication and validation and where value-exchange interactions are recorded. This avoids some of the overhead and issues with - Proof of work: Where the agent must prove that they've performed some computational work to prevent low-effort spam bots. - Proof of stake: Where the agent must put up value that can be taken in case of bad behaviour. - ProofO
 of authority: Where an agent must have a signature from a pre-defined authority to join. Self-sovereign identity contributes to personal wellbeing, and enables the only real sustainable solution. One's Personal Chain serves as the foundation for establishing credibility, relevance, and trust within the system. Personal data that's available to secure and monetize for limited contractual use can include demographic details, skills, interests, past interactions, the personal chain (record of value exchanges) calculates relevancy for various qualities. It is a feature to avoid subjective or irrelevant reputation scores.

**Needs and Has:** Users can express their needs and offerings through the system. "Needs" represent specific requirements or requests for resources, services, or assistance. "Has" denote the resources or services that users can provide or make available to others. These elements drive the matching process, connecting users with complementary needs and has.

**Location-Based Relevance:** The data model incorporates location information to facilitate localized interactions and resource allocation. Users' geographical coordinates or proximity to specific areas are considered in the matching process, enabling nearby individuals and communities to connect and engage effectively.

**Community Chains:** Users have the option to join communities based on proximity or shared interests. Community chains capture the collective needs, has, and interactions within a specific community. These chains enable community-driven collaborations, resource pooling, and collective decision-making.

**Secure Messaging:** The data model includes a secure messaging system that allows users to communicate, negotiate, and coordinate exchanges within the system. Messaging functionality ensures privacy, encryption, and user-defined data sharing policies, fostering secure and trusted interactions.

**Metadata and Validation:** Metadata associated with each interaction, such as timestamps, endorsements, and transaction details, contributes to the validation and verification process. By relying on objective metadata from blockchain entries, the system ensures the authenticity and relevance of user interactions.

The Has-Needs data model is designed to empower individuals and communities, providing a robust foundation for efficient resource allocation, collaboration, and transparent interactions. It promotes self-sovereign identity, privacy, and security while enabling meaningful connections and exchanges between users.
