Utilizing blockchain technology and secure identity management, Has-Needs creates a decentralized network for seamlessly matching needs with available resources.

### Executive Summary:

Has-Needs is a transformative system addressing inefficiencies in disaster management, community interactions, and commerce. Leveraging blockchain technology and secure identity management, our platform empowers individuals to control their recovery and resource-sharing processes. Central to our system is the concept of personal blockchains, offering users complete control over their data and interactions while ensuring anonymity and privacy.

Our platform enables users to publish their needs and available resources, creating a dynamic marketplace where matching occurs based on proximity and relevance. Utilizing metadata from blockchain entries, we establish objective measures of relevance, allowing users to make informed decisions about resource allocation. This approach removes subjective biases and fosters transparent and efficient exchanges within communities.

Through the Has-Needs system, individuals gain sovereignty over their identities and interactions, mitigating trauma and empowering their recovery journey. Our platform also fosters civic engagement, enabling users to interact with public agencies, political offices, and community organizations to address pressing needs and facilitate collaborative efforts.

Beyond disaster management, Has-Needs revolutionizes commerce. By providing verified identities and enabling anonymous matching of needs and products, we transform traditional marketing practices. Vendors can describe their products as "Has," while users express their needs, leading to targeted incentives, discounts, and mutually beneficial transactions.

Join us in shaping a future where individuals and communities regain control over their recovery, interactions, and commerce. Together, we can create a more resilient and empowered society.
