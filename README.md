    return data.toString();
}
```

**Raymarching for Location Privacy**

Raymarching abstracts and protects user location data, ensuring privacy and security. The system processes relevant matches, knows the location of the asset, knows the user location, and then sends the user directions from their location in the form of a vector (direction) and distance. The user's device can easily calculate the position and then use apps to reach it. The benefit of this system is that only meaningless relative directions are sent through the network, that gain meaning once processed in the security of the user's handheld.

```javascript
// Raymarching for Location Privacy
function getRaymarchedDirections(userLocation, assetLocation) {
    // Calculate directions using raymarching algorithm
    const directions = calculateDirections(userLocation, assetLocation);
    return directions;
}

function calculateDirections(start, end) {
    const deltaX = end.x - start.x;
    const deltaY = end.y - start.y;
    const distance = Math.sqrt(deltaX * deltaX + deltaY * deltaY);
    const angle = Math.atan2(deltaY, deltaX);
    return { distance, angle };
}
```

**Event-Driven Architecture**

The event-driven architecture of Has-Needs captures feedback from completed smart contracts, enhancing the system’s ability to learn from interactions and improve its matching and recommendation algorithms over time.

```javascript
// Event-Driven Architecture Example
const EventEmitter = require('events');

// Event handler for completed smart contracts
eventEmitter.on('smartContractCompleted', (contract) => {
    console.log('Smart contract completed:', contract);
    // Update system state based on the completed contract
    updateSystemState(contract);
});

// Function to emit a smart contract completion event
function completeSmartContract(contract) {
    eventEmitter.emit('smartContractCompleted', contract);
}

// Example of completing a smart contract
const exampleContract = { id: 1, parties: ['userA', 'userB'], terms: 'Sample terms' };
completeSmartContract(exampleContract);
```

The Social Media Access panel occupies a corner on the lower right or left side of the screen. This quarter-circle interface expands into concentric layers with a gradient from red-orange to orange-yellow. Vertical movement adjusts the reach of the message, from email (one person) to blog post (whole world). Lateral movement adjusts the security level, changing the color of the layer to indicate the privacy level of the message.

```javascript
// Social Media Access Panel Interface
const socialMediaServices = [
    { name: 'Email', reach: 1, security: 'private' },
    { name: 'Blog Post', reach: 1000000, security: 'public' },
    // Add more services as needed
];

function displaySocialMediaPanel() {
    // Code to display the quarter-circle interface and handle user input
}

function handleUserInput(input) {
    const { vertical, horizontal } = input;
    // Calculate reach and security based on input
    const reach = calculateReach(vertical);
    const security = calculateSecurity(horizontal);
    updatePanelDisplay(reach, security);
}

function calculateReach(vertical) {
    // Calculate reach based on vertical input
    return vertical * 1000000; // Example calculation
}

function calculateSecurity(horizontal) {
    // Calculate security based on horizontal input
    return horizontal > 0.5 ? 'public' : 'private'; // Example calculation
}

function updatePanelDisplay(reach, security) {
    // Update the UI to reflect the selected reach and security level
    console.log(`Reach: ${reach}, Security: ${security}`);
    // Additional code to update the UI elements
}
```

**Example Workflow: Social Media Posting**

1. The user interacts with the Social Media Access panel by dragging their thumb vertically and horizontally.
2. The UI updates to show the selected reach and security level based on the user's input.
3. The user confirms the selection and posts the message, which is then distributed to the selected social media services according to the specified reach and security.
