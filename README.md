# Elevator Pitch:
Introducing Has-Needs, a groundbreaking platform that empowers individuals and communities to take control of their recovery and resource sharing. Our innovative system leverages blockchain technology and secure identity management to create a decentralized network where users can seamlessly match their needs with available resources. By providing individuals with a personal blockchain and safeguarding their identities, we ensure privacy, trust, and efficient interactions. Join us in revolutionizing disaster management, community empowerment, and commerce.

## Executive Summary:
Has-Needs is a transformative system designed to address the limitations and inefficiencies in disaster management, community interactions, and commerce. By leveraging blockchain technology and secure identity management, our platform empowers individuals to take charge of their recovery and resource sharing processes. At the core of our system is the concept of personal blockchains, which provide users with complete control over their data and interactions while ensuring anonymity and privacy.

Our platform enables users to publish their needs and available resources, creating a dynamic marketplace where matching occurs based on proximity and relevance. By utilizing metadata from blockchain entries, we establish objective measures of relevance, allowing users to make informed decisions about resource allocation. This approach removes subjective biases and fosters a transparent and efficient exchange of goods, services, and support within communities.

Through the Has-Needs system, individuals gain sovereignty over their identities and interactions, mitigating trauma and empowering them in their recovery journey. Our platform also fosters civic engagement, as users can interact with public agencies, political offices, and community organizations to address pressing needs and facilitate collaborative efforts.

In addition to its impact on disaster management, the Has-Needs system has significant implications for commerce. By providing individuals with verified identities and enabling anonymous matching of needs and products, we revolutionize traditional marketing practices. Vendors can describe their products as "Has," while users can express their needs, leading to targeted incentives, discounts, and mutually beneficial transactions.

Join us in shaping a future where individuals and communities regain control over their recovery, interactions, and commerce. Together, we can create a more resilient and empowered society.
